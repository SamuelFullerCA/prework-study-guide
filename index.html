          <li>JavaScript code runs form the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page.</li>
          <li>Control flow can be interrupted with conditional statements and loops.</li>

          <li>Computer will continue through all conditions in a if else list intil it meets a condition that is truthy, then execude the code in yhe curly brackets assocated with the statement.</li>
